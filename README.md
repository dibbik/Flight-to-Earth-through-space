Flight to Earth through space

The project was implemented in Unity 2021.3.26f using Playmarket v.1.9.6 created, and asset https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/space-star-field-backgrounds-109689

and a script for flight control as in zero gravity.

I used the PlayMaket module to rotate the Earth.
